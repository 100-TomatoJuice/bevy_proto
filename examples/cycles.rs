//! This example demonstrates how cycles are handled.
//!
//! A cycle is where a prototype recursively references itself.
//! In other words, it is found in its own template chain or child hierarchy.
//!
//! In this example, `CycleA` is loaded.
//! However, it inherits from `CycleB`, which contains child `CycleC`,
//! which inherits `CycleA`â€” oh no, a cycle!
//!
//! By default, this will panic, resulting in the following message:
//!
//! ```
//! found prototype cycle: `"examples/cycles/CycleA.prototype.ron" inherits "examples/cycles/CycleB.prototype.ron" which contains "examples/cycles/CycleC.prototype.ron" which inherits "examples/cycles/CycleA.prototype.ron"`
//! ```
//!
//! However, we can also choose to simply ignore the cycle by configuring [`ProtoConfig`].
//! If ignored, a detected cycle will just skip the recursion and move on.
//! If we did that here, we'd spawn two entities: `CycleA (CycleB)` and `CycleC`
//! where `CycleC` does not inherit from `CycleA` (due to the skipped cycle).
